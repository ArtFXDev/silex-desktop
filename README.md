Silex desktop is the Electron application that serves all the frontend apps of the pipeline.

## Introduction

In order to access the filesystem and other OS specific features that are hidden in the browser, we use Electron.

Electron is a chromium based browser and enables us to package the frontend applications of the pipeline into a single desktop app for users.

We also have [silex-socket-service](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-socket-service) as a dependency so the socket server is started automatically on startup.

## Installation

The package manager used is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
