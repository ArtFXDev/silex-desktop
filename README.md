Silex desktop is the Electron application that serves all the frontend apps of the pipeline.

## Introduction

In order to access the filesystem and other OS specific features that are hidden in the browser, we use Electron.

Electron is a chromium based browser and enables us to package the frontend applications of the pipeline into a single desktop app for users.

We also have [silex-socket-service](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-socket-service) as a dependency so the socket server is started automatically on startup.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Since the desktop application requires [silex-socket-service](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-socket-service) as a dependency and it's part of the ArtFX organization, you need to do the following:

- Create a `.npmrc` file in the root folder with that content:

  ```properties
  //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
  @artfxdev:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
  ```

- Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>` with your GitHub access token (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for where to get it).

### Install dependencies

The package manager used is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ArtFXDev/silex-desktop
$ cd silex-desktop
$ yarn install # Install the dependencies
```

## Usage

### Available scripts

- ðŸš€ `yarn start` -> Opens an instance of the Electron app
